# BotFreeNetD

This is an open-source tool created for the purpose of gaining access to the internet while removing site restrictions placed by the freebasics program.

This tool is NOT for getting free data, but it grants you the ability to use the freebasics 20MB allocation for something of your choice.

## Usage

* start up the facebook application and enter free mode or open this [link](https://free.facebook.com)

* send a friend request to [Solomon Nasdaq](https://www.facebook.com/solomonnasdaqq) and join the [freenetD page](https://fb.me/freenetd).

* You will be made an administrator before you proceed.

* [Head on to messenger and send a url to the bot.](https://m.me/freenetd)

* If it all goes well, you should receive a raw http response that can be put to use by a custom-made client-side browser.
